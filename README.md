#### Our project

- Create a chatbot, trained on review, plot and can be asked about a movie question.
- Create a face recognition on celebs from movie posters
- Maybe create a movie recommendation based on users former watches

### Business case

Select one or more business or social domains, where AI can bring value. Formulate a problem statement, context,
research question(s), and hypotheses for your AI solution.

### Data

Searching Internet and other media, find relevant data sources that can be used in your experiments.
Ingest and pre-process the collected data into proper data structures, applying data wrangling techniques. Explore
and explain the data by statistics and visualisation.

### AI Models

Select three or more AI methods and algorithms that could solve the problem. Create, train, and/or augment
relevant data models applying supervised or unsupervised machine learning, artificial neural networks, knowledge
graphs, or large language models.
Test the models created by the learners operating on test data sets, as well as on new data sets (training, test and
validation sets)

### Quality Assessment

Select appropriate statistics for measuring the quality of your models. Calculate measures assessing the quality of
the models and their ability to produce intelligent prediction, prescription, or generation.
Iterate the data modelling operations, improving the quality of the models, as much as possible.
Compare the assessment results and use them to select the best performing models. Save these models in data
stores for further implementation.

### AI Application

Implement the data and the successful AI operations into an interactive application with simple user interface,
presenting the process and results in human-understandable form.
Apply various visualisation and explanation techniques to guide the users through the application and interpret the
insights revealed by the AI algorithms.

Deploy the solution locally (on localhost) or on a cloud of your choice.
